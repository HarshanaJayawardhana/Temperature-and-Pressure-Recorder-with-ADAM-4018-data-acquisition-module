# Temperature-and-Pressure-Recorder-with-ADAM-4018-data-acquisition-module

I was assigned to install a temperature and pressure recording system. This recorder was introduced to recode temperatures and pressures of the curing machine in the bias plant. Even already use a paper chart type recorder for this. This system used two pressure sensors and two temperature sensors whose outputs are 4 – 20 mA and 0 - 10V respectively. The resulting analog readings are connected to a computer via an ADAM – 4018+ data acquisition module (Figure 01). The recorder is coded by the visual studio, based on Easy Modbus and Microsoft excel libraries. The interface of the developed recorder system is shown in Figure 02.

### Objectives of this system are:
-	Recorded internal temperatures and pressures
-	Recorded Dome temperatures and pressures
-	Temperatures and pressures were viewed in real times
-	Recorded data save in Microsoft excel sheet every 30 seconds
-	Microsoft excel files were saved every day at 6.00 am
